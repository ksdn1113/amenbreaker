# Amen Breaker
WIP

As a diehard fan of IDM, granular synthesis and batshit breakcore, I wanted to build my own sequencer with multiple amen breaks loaded (as an example, otherwise it could be loaded with other breaks or sounds) which are trimmed up to my own designs. This mainly serves as an intro, this as the project is developed more detailed info regarding its workarounds will be updated.

The main idea is to make it in PD, and maybe implement some other algorithms in Python for control wherever PD feels like it needs a little extra. Once it's built, it would be desired to implement some sort of midi interface, although the prototype might end as a patch for MobMuPlat, or even a vst for Ableton. 

# Main Idea of Flowchart

In this Miro diagram, there is a prototype of a flowchart design in how the amen breaker wishes to be working.
